### Scoreboard API Module
## Overview
The Scoreboard API module is responsible for managing user scores on a website, providing a real-time scoreboard showing the top 10 users. This module will handle score updates based on user actions and ensure secure and authorized score increments to prevent fraudulent activities.

### Features
## Real-Time Scoreboard:
Displays the top 10 user scores.
Automatically updates in real-time whenever a user's score changes.

## Secure Score Updates:
API endpoint for updating user scores.
Prevents unauthorized score updates by validating user actions.

## Scalability:
Efficient handling of frequent score updates.
Optimized to support a large number of users.
### API Endpoints
## 1. Update Score
Endpoint: POST /api/score/update
Description: Updates the score of a user based on a specific action.
Request Body:
{
  "userId": "string",
  "actionId": "string",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601"
}
Response:
{
  "status": "success",
  "newScore": "number"
}

## Authorization:
API uses JWT tokens for user validation.
The actionId is validated against a secure service to confirm the legitimacy of the action.

## 2. Get Top Scores
Endpoint: GET /api/score/top
Description: Retrieves the top 10 user scores.
Response:
{
  "topScores": [
    {"userId": "string", "score": "number"}
  ]
}

### Flow of Execution : 

## User Action:
A user performs an action on the website.

## API Request:
The website dispatches an API request to /api/score/update, including the userId, actionId, and timestamp.

## Authorization:
The backend verifies the JWT token and validates the actionId with an external service.

## Score Update:
If authorized, the user's score is incremented in the database.

## Real-Time Update:
The updated score triggers a real-time update to the scoreboard, refreshing the top 10 users if necessary.
Improvements and Considerations

## Rate Limiting:
Implement rate limiting on the score update endpoint to prevent abuse.

## Cache Optimization:
Utilize caching (e.g., Redis) for the top 10 scores to reduce database load.

## Audit Logging:
Maintain an audit log of all score updates for monitoring and debugging purposes.

## WebSocket for Real-Time Updates:
Implement WebSocket or similar real-time communication protocol for pushing updates to the frontend.

## Dependencies
Node.js: Backend runtime environment.
Express.js: Web framework for API creation.
MongoDB: Database for storing user scores.
Redis: Optional, for caching top scores.
JWT: For user authentication and action authorization.
WebSocket: For real-time communication with the frontend.
